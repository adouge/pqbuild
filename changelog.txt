1.2.0 - 17.03.2022:
  - Rewrote using a "homemade" shutil.copytree variant to:
    a) properly handle excluding whole folders
    b) make the script usable on Python 3.7, where shutil.copytree doesn't
    have the dirs_exist_ok parameter.
  - renamed pqbuild.main call method to pqbuild.run
  - dropped redundant/unused "clean" option in Builder.build()

1.1.0 - 02.11.2021:
  - Added ability to define multiple build targets

1.0.0 - 12.10.2021: Initial version
