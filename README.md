## pqbuild - Python Qt BUILDer
Small build script for "building" Python apps. Originally used in the Python/Qt (PySide6) stack, with deployment in venvs on machines in an internal network.
(Might be totally useless given `make` exists.)

See sample buildspec file / main class docstring for info.

Requires PyYAML.
